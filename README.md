# MIDI-Bass-Sustain-Pedal
This repository is for a MIDI sustain "pedal" specifically made for the iOS app iFretless Bass, because it hasn't a susutain button built-in.

It is made fo the Arduino Pro Micro, which supports USB MIDI.
It uses two tactile buttons, one for switching the sustain from normally off to normally on and vice-versa, and the other one for switching the sustain momentarily, like  a piano.

I hope it is useful for anyone who uses this app.
